Docker setup for Jenkins master. 

Agents to follow! Currently we are running all jobs on master which is not recommended. Work in progress!

Name of the image will change after adding agents. 

To connect to the swarm:
- ask Christina for SSH keys and passphrases (used doctorlink as username when creating it and the SSH2 RSA public key)
- username: doctorlink
